# Hangman
This is a simple version of the game Hangman, written in Python.

This is my first attempt at writing the Hangman game into Python.
This first version was written on a windows machine, so I lacked access to an internal dictionary to pull words from. 
This can be implemented in most Linux distributions.

My goal as of 4/7/18 is to add a GUI to this program that will include score keeping and the standard features of a videogame.
